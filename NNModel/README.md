This file contains three notebooks for training, analyzing, and exporting a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model. The project includes data preparation, modeling, and exporting to the ONNX format. 

File Structure

modeloHAR.ipynb: Contains the implementation and training of the Human Activity Recognition model.

Data.ipynb: Responsible for data analysis and preparation used in model training.

Onnx.ipynb: Converts the trained model to the ONNX format, making it easier to use across different platforms.

Run the notebooks in the following order:

Data.ipynb for data preparation.

modeloHAR.ipynb for model training.

Onnx.ipynb for model export.
