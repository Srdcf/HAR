## **NNModel**
This file contains three notebooks for training and exporting a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model. The project includes modeling, and exporting to the ONNX format. 

# Technologies Used:
Tensorflow (v2) for trainning the NNModel

Onnx (v1.18.0) 

## **File Structure**

modeloHAR.ipynb: Contains the implementation and training of the Human Activity Recognition model.

Onnx.ipynb: Converts the trained model to the ONNX format, making it easier to use across different platforms.



## **Run the notebooks in the following order:**

modeloHAR.ipynb for model training.

Onnx.ipynb for model export.
